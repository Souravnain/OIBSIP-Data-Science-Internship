# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project is part of the **AICTE OIBSIP Internship** offered by **Oasis Infobyte**.

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that can classify Iris flowers into three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — based on the length and width of their petals and sepals.

## 📂 Dataset
We used the built-in **Iris dataset** provided by the `scikit-learn` library. It contains:
- 150 samples
- 4 features: 
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- 3 Classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 🐍
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models Applied
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📊 Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy Score
- Data Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## ✅ Result
The classification models were trained successfully with high accuracy. Among the models tested, [mention your best-performing model] gave the highest accuracy of **[your accuracy]%**.
